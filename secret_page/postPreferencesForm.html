        <h1>Neat Little Form — My Answers</h1>
        <h3>These are my answers to the questions on the form</h3>
        <div class ="formAlike">
            <p>How would you like me to refer to you? </p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>Ummm... i don't know. probably "david" or something, i don't really care</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What sort of stuff do you enjoy doing?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>Most of my free time I spend either watching Youtube videos (usually educational stuff) or playing a video game (usually Terraria) to recover energy. On the occasions where I have both energy and free time, I enjoy doing other more creative stuff. I usually either play an instrument (either one that I know like percussion stuff or one that I'm trying to learn) or fiddle with computer stuff (some examples include installing Arch Linux on my old laptop, configuring my old desktop I now use as a server, or hacking my video game consoles). I also spend quite a bit of time researching and learning about folk music</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What types of music do you usually enjoy listening to? Are there any specific people/groups?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>Almost entirely folk music, including modern songs in the same style. My favourite living group is The Longest Johns, a Bristolian nautical song/shanty group. They sing songs primarily in the style of sea shanties (namely the modern definition, but I won't go into the semantics of that here), and have written many very fun songs. As for overall favourite groups (I.E. including dead and living), I love The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem — one of the most influential Irish-American folk bands (Liam Clancy's voice is gorgeous) — and The Corries, a Scottish folk group who have written some of the most popular Scottish folk songs including Flower of Scotland, which won a poll on potential national anthems for Scotland.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What colours do you like? Do you have a particular favourite? </p><br/>
            <textarea readonly>I would say my favourite colour would be particular shades of purple in the right context. However, blue is much more dynamic and universally good. Basically any shade of blue looks pretty in most contexts.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What is something you are proud of?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>This is a hard question for me. Right this moment, I am quite proud of this site. It looks surprisingly good given that this is the first time I've coded in the past 2(ish) years, and the last time was a project that was way too big for my skills and inconsistent motivation. I think this feels much more pleasant than a simple google form, even though that would have taken only about an hour and this took many. The server that I have set up is also pretty cool, at least to me.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What types of foods do you like?</p><br/>
            <textarea readonly>I quite like chocolate a lot. It mixes well with a great many things, and chocolate bars have a very inoffensive texture. The darker it is, the better in my mind (up to about 70% cacao for most brands, though I imagine nicer chocolate can easily be higher. I'd like to try some at some point). I also enjoy potatoes a lot, and most beef, chicken, and pork is usually very good. My family has a lot of recipes that are delicious, like banana bread, chicken and rice, apple sauce, and what we call "ghetto-omelettes" and "french bread pizza". A lot of them are also pretty easy, which is quite nice.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What types of foods do you <b>not</b> like?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>Now this is where things get complicated. I am very picky, and most of the things I dislike are based on texture. One of the only things I hate based on flavour is peanut butter. Most things with a weird texture difference I don't like, such as sausages with the hard(ish) but not crunchy skin and soft inside. The weirdest one though is based on shape; I've found that any food that is too spherical makes me hate it. This means that most berries and berry-like foods are right out. The border on what counts is extremely fuzzy too. For example, I won't take an orange, peel it, then eat it, but if you give me pre-peeled orange/orange slice, I will gladly eat it. I don't know why; it's probably easier to learn more specifics in person with a non-text conversation</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What is your favourite aspect ratio (such as in computer monitors and TVs)?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>I'm not going to recreate the multiple-choice thing here — each individual option takes more code than an entire text box. But my answer to this is 16:10. I think that it works really well for desktop stuff and video games, since you get just a bit more height than 16:9, which makes it feel quite a bit more immersive. It's also apparently perfect to have two pages of a book side-by side on the screen. Unfortunately I can't find any big 16:10 monitors. It's really annoying how it doesn't really exist anymore; everyone makes screens super wide and it loses the entire vertical perspective.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>Now for the question that has plagued humanity for generations: Cats or dogs?</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>If I'm being completely honest, I mostly added this for the cheap joke of infrastructure person. It's based on a Tom Scott video about how weird his audience is. I generally prefer cats over dogs, mostly because they usually feel a bit more relatable for me. I only know how to interact with animals about as well as I know how to interact with people; which is to say not at all. I would probably pick infrastructure, mostly because it's largely mechanical and structural engineering, which is something my brain can wrap around. I'm less interested in biology than I am engineering and physics, so infrastructure is more fun to learn about for me. I have nothing against cats or dogs, but I like to learn, and infrastructure is more fun to learn about in my brain.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>What would you name this owl? <br/> <img src="../Images/owlToBeNamed.jpg" alt="An owl image ripped from the Wikipedia page for Owl"></p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>Again, this question is entirely a Tom Scott rip. I just grabbed a different image of an owl. I think I'd call him Mike From Accounting. He's just woken up and hasn't had his coffee yet. Don't talk to him until he's had his morning coffee.</textarea><br/><br/>
            <p>Other Questions</p> <br/>
            <textarea readonly>I'm not going to answer the next ones, since they're basically just "tell me what you think" type ones</textarea><br/><br/>
