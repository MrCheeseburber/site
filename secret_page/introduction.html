        <h1>Hello There</h1>
        <h2>This is a goofy little thing I decided to make, mostly for my own enjoyment</h2>
        <div><br/>You're probably here because I gave you a little note that directed you here. Either that or you were looking through my code (which if that's the case: rude. i had a comment saying not to look too closely). But I'm going to assume that's not what happened, and that you're here because of <i>the note</i>.
        <br/><br/> As you now know... I like you, and am extremely awkward. I thought of this idea when I was going to bed one night and was really excited to make a new webpage (it's been a while since I last programed, this has been a fun project). As I hopefully remembered to detail in the note, everything here is purely your choice to participate or to not. If you don't participate at all, that is totally fine, I will not be offended in the slightest (again, I mostly made this for my own enjoyment).<br/><br/>
        On this page, I will include a few things that might be able to help you know a few basic things about me and vise versa. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.<br/><br/>
        That is probably all the information you need to navigate this site, below I will link pages for the afformentioned purpose, with a small description of what they are. <br/><br/>
        Also, I think you know that I formerly dated Reese ("formerly" as of a bit before Thanksgiving). If you think that you should ask her opinion or discuss anything with her before making any decision or anything like that, please do. I don't want to ruin any friendships or anything, and if you think that you shouldtalk to her about it then you absolutely should.</div>

            <p>This is a form for me to learn a little more about you if you want</p>

            <p>I designed this section to work as a more public-facing thing. It has some stuff about me. It doesn't have a way to come back here unless you use the back button on your browser</p>

            <p>So this entire thing has a bit of an implied question. If you want to answer it through here, this is where you'd want to go</p>
