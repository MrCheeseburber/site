        <h1>Neat Little Form</h1>
        <h3>Here's a form I made you can fill out if you want</h3>
        <div>This is just a little form that I made because I might like to know some basic information about you. If you don't want to answer any of the questions, you don't have to; it's totally fine to leave anything blank. I'll have my answers to all of these in a separate page linked at the end of this form. You may input as much or as little as you want</div>
        <form action="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzBbHne_KECSzEwDZKNWmUKCieZ4PiefBni59tiuPyIlICEbJOCnr7ePXaeoVkFlr2h/exec" method="POST">

            <p>Once you click this, it will send you to a (kind of) random google site with a weird little programmer thing confirming that either it worked or it didn't (hopefully that it did). This means that I got the form data. To return to this page, use the back arrow on your browser or return to the introduction page again like you did the first time. <br/>I would have loved to have it automatically redirect you to my responses to the form, but I could not properly figure that out. This is due to the fact that I am not good at coding. Sorry</p>
