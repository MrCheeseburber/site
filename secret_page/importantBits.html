        <h1>Hello again</h1>
        <h2>This is where I put information that I think is important. It's kind of organized</h2>
        <h3>My current future plans</h3>
        <div>So the first bit I think I should share relates to what I will do in the future. After this school year, I am planning on attending East Tennessee State University (ETSU) in Johnson City, Tennessee. This is because I plan on enrolling under their "Bluegrass, Old-Time, and Roots Music Studies" major. I think my main "dream job" would be to become an archivist, and work directly with historical documents, especially if those documents pertain to folk music. ETSU has the only folk music-y program I could find, and also offers programs in library science — which would be useful, especially if I end up pursuing a Master's degree.</div>
        <h3>Weird brain things</h3>
        <div>
            So my brain is really weird. While I haven't been diagnosed with anything, I am pretty sure I am autistic and have ADHD. The main things this effects (outside of... my entire personality) is that I can be very sensitive to sensory input. If a room has too many sounds happening (especially speech), it gets very overwhelming for me. Bright lights and loud noises are also physically painful to me, partially by themselves and partially on account of my chronic headaches. 
            <br/> I also have some issues with energy and focus. The amount of energy I have on any given day is very difficult to predict. I get distracted and forget things very easily. This combos very annoyingly with the fact that making my brain do things is hard. It's not super uncommon for me to, for example, go "oh I should text <i>person</i> about <i>thing</i>", then not have the willpower to do it immediately, and forget to text <i>person</i> about <i>thing</i> until much later, when the exact same thing happens again. Yay. 
            <br/> I think it I might also want to mention some less consistently annoying things about my brain. I don't have a whole lot of things that I really enjoy, but the things I do I tend to get very interested in. For example: a few years ago we played a couple Celtic folk pieces in band (<i>Down By The Salley Gardens</i> and <i>Loch Lomond</i>). This was a bit of a kickoff into a very intense interest in Celtic folk music and, to a lesser extend, folk music in general. I won't go into too much detail here, but I now have over 900 songs on my computer (though admittedly somewhere around half of them are duplicate recordings of the same song) and I know at least something about most of them, whether it be historical context or general narrative, and several I can sing from memory in full (barring social anxiety). Also I'm literally going to college to study folk music.
            <br/> <br/> In short, while I am quite good at a good few things, most things that I am not "pretty good" at end up being things I am quite bad at. Like social interaction. <br/> Especially social interaction.

        <h3>Summary/What this means for you</h3>
        <div>
            So if you're reading this, it's probably because I am interested in starting a relationship with you. I want to start with full transparency, and I am much more articulate through text than I am through speech. I don't personally see a whole lot of appeal to actively seeking a relationship for the purpose of being temporary. That's not to say I am against ending relationships — if ending it is what is best for one or more parties, then so be it — but starting one with the express purpose of it ending after some time feels... odd to me. That's why I started this section with my future plans. Tennessee is not at all close to Colorado, and I want your decision on the matter to be fully informed
            <br/> The other stuff involving my brain is quite difficult to describe, especially in a concise way. There's many facets that I don't have the ability to fully describe in one stretch. I just want to explain some of the challenges I have, and generally just a bit about how my brain works.
            <br/><br/> My main goal with a relationship is that both of us are able to be happy. While I do require some accommodation with the things that are difficult for me, I hope that I can make that as easy as possible, and I would try to accommodate for and help you any way I can. The main purpose of this entire site is to explain some of the things I think are important in a way that I can explain them. The secondary purpose was for me to have some fun with html and coding; it's been a while since I've done either of those.
