        <h1>That One Place</h1>
        <div>
            <br/>So if you're here, it's probably because I like you. I think me saying this has a bit of a question implied in it. If I'm being honest, I'm not sure how to best phrase the question, which is why I haven't actually said it anywhere here. Just to make sure that it is clear, I am asking you out. I don't know how to phrase that sentence properly as a question. <br/>
            <br/>I think that if I were to be given something like this, I probably wouldn't really know how to respond (especially if my answer were no). For that reason, I'm adding this page with a small form on it so that, if you don't want to initiate a conversation or would rather use this for any reason, it is available. <br/>
            <br/>While I can't say anything about what my emotional reaction to either answer here would be, I will not hold what you choose against you. I would like for you to be able to choose whatever option you want. I hope I've been able to make that clear; there is no need to feel guilty if you decide that you'd rather not. <br/>
            <br/>Also, you absolutely do not need to use this form at all. If you'd rather do something else, you are more than welcome to. I just put this here so that it is an option available to you if you would like.<br/>
            <br/>With that disclaimer (hopefully) out of the way, and hopefully the question vaguely defined in such a way that you understand what I am asking, here it is <br/> <br/>
        </div>
        <form action="https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzBbHne_KECSzEwDZKNWmUKCieZ4PiefBni59tiuPyIlICEbJOCnr7ePXaeoVkFlr2h/exec" method="POST">
            <h3>What is your answer to my question?</h3>
            <input class="bigBubble" type='radio' id='Yes' name='bigQuestion' value='Yes'> 
                    <label class="bigRadio" for='Yes'>Yes</label> <br/>
            <input class="bigBubble" type='radio' id='No' name='bigQuestion' value='No'> 
                    <label class="bigRadio" for='No'>No</label> <br/>
            <input class="bigBubble" type='radio' id='Other' name='bigQuestion' value='Other'> 
                    <label class="bigRadio" for='Other'>Other</label> <br/> <br/>
            <label for="bigQuestionExtention">If you would like to expand on your answer, I have put a text input here</label> <br/>
                <textarea name="bigQuestionExtention" id='bigQuestionExtention'></textarea><br/><br/>
                    
            <div>Just like the other form, this will lead you to a weird google webpage due to my bad coding skills. That means I got the answer, you can use the back button on your browser to get back here</div>
            <input type="submit" value="Submit">
        </form>
        <button onclick="window.location.href='./introduction.html';">Click here to return to the introduction page</button>
