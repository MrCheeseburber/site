        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Created as a semi-organized list</h2>
        <!-- Beginning of "Things I Like" section -->
        <h3>Things I like</h3>
            <div class="List">Folk music, especially Celtic folk music ——— For information about my specific tastes, click <button  class="inlineButton" onclick="window.location.href = './MusicTastes.html';">here</button></div>
            <div class="List">Playing instruments, especially the ones I am pretty good at. I like learning new ones too, when I have motivation and money</div>
            <div class="List">Live theatre. If I had more energy (or it required less), I would love to perform on stage again. Alas, watching it is still lovely</div>
            <div class="List">Video games. I don't play that many, but here are some that I enjoy:</div>
                <div class="subList">Terraria</div>
                <div class="subList">30XX</div>
                <div class="subList">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</div>
                <div class="subList">Really the entire Zelda series</div>
                <div class="subList">Pokemon (especially pre-gen 8)</div>
                <div class="subList">Mariokart (especially 8, 8 Deluxe, Wii, and Double Dash)</div>
                <div class="subList">Slay the Princess</div>
                <div class="subList">Minecraft sometimes</div>
            <div class="List">Linux</div>
            <div class="List">Playing with custom computer stuff ——— For information about my setup, click <button  class="inlineButton" onclick="window.location.href = './ComputerSetup.html';">here</button></div> 
            <div class="List">Old technology, especially ones that don't use computers and are just clever bits of engineering</div>
            <div class="List">Learning in general; here are some specific things I really enjoy learning about:</div>
                <div class="subList">Instruments — especially obscure instruments — and how sound works</div>
                <div class="subList">Fun vocal techniques, such as overtone singing and subharmonics</div>
                <div class="subList">Audio equipment, especially headphones and custom sound systems</div>
                <div class="subList">Computer science stuff; the fundamentals of how the digital world functions</div>
                <div class="subList">Mathematics, but not how school teaches it. I like it when there's a specific application and it functions as an extension of logic</div>
                <div class="subList">History, especially as a way to contextualize stories ——— there's probably more detail in the <button  class="inlineButton" onclick="window.location.href = './MusicTastes.html';">folk music page</button></div>
                <div class="subList">Linguistics and etymology</div>
            <div class="List">Physical media. Give us back our disk drives and cartridges!</div>
        <!-- Beginning of "Things I Dislike" section -->
        <h3>Things I dislike</h3>
            <div class="List">Food that is too round/spherical. Yes, I'm completely serious. I don't know why. If you want an elaboration, it'd be best to ask me in person</div>
            <div class="List">Crowds and chaotic/loud sounds. It's very overwhelming</div>
            <div class="List">Being touched unexpectedly and/or nonconsentually. Once again, overwhelming.</div>
            <div class="List">Sports and forced physical exertion. I have very limited energy, and it hurts</div>
            <div class="List">Being told to do things. This makes that thing substantially harder to do, and drains my energy quickly</div>
            <div class="List">Polo shirts. I think it might be leftover from when I was forced into wearing a crappy polo every day for school, but also they're just uncomfortable</div>
            <div class="List">Migraines. I get them a lot. They suck. A lot</div>
            <div class="List">Back pain. What do you mean I can't sit down and do things for hours on end in a comfortable position? Rude</div>
            <div class="List">Really just any random pain. Why must you do this, body, to hurt me for no reason</div>
            <div class="List">Synthesized drumkits. Sometimes they can work for a specific context, but it's usually too harsh of a sound and is too stiff for my taste</div>
            <div class="List">Drum mics. It can work, but usually has too much focus on bass and snare for my taste. I'd usually rather someone stick a nice microphone in front of the kit and let the flavour of the kit and drummer shine</div>
