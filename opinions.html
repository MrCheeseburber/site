        <h2>I felt like writing some of my opinions down; here they are</h2>
        <h3>Studio Drumkit Recording</h3>
        <div>
            For context: I am primarily a concert percussionist, and when I play drumkit it's almost exclusively jazz. I also have fairly sensitive ears, so what may be fun and groovy for some is often harsh and a bit painful for me, especially when it comes to kit. I have what I think is a reasonably unique perspective, and I'd imagine many of my complaints aren't an issue to most people; I have chronic migraines and am very sensitive to sound. Also I am usually listening with headphones, and I think a lot of music is probably made for use with speakers <br/>
            <br/>I don't like drum mics. Most of the time, all the balance of the kit is very carefully manufactured by the sound engineer. This usually removes most of the character and individuality of the kit and player, making every drummer sound like every other drummer, and every kit like every other kit. I hate this. Every drumkit has its own character to its sound, and every player has subtle differences in how they play. Most applications of drum mics shred the nuance of the instrument to make it the same as everyone else in the industry <br/>
            <br/>Additionally, in most setups the sound is all focused on the bass and snare drums. If you're lucky you get a hi-hat and ride mic. When it's mixed, the bass drum is usually the most emphasized part. In stereo, it is commonly equal between both sides of the listener. This makes it have next to no feeling of soundstage — like it's coming from somewhere — and is usually just a thumping that is way too harsh and penetrates my skull, even on my nice semi-open backed headphones (Samson SR850). There is hardly any of the cymbals, and when there is a nice amount it's not uncommon for it to feel sheer and have a huge amount of attack. While many cymbals have a very strong attack and slightly sheer sound, it's usually not as harsh as recordings make it out to be. It's probably my background in jazz that says this, but I want a delicate bass drum and a full cymbal. None of this ear-ripping skull-pounding harshness that is so many drum recordings. <br/>
            <br/>Most of this also applies to drum machines that are just a sampled loop with no flair. I don't even know where to begin with the sampled snare and hi-hat sounds. The snare drum is an instrument that responds to <i>everything</i> you do. Any little change in how you hit the drum will noticeably alter the sound. In my opinion, most snare samples sound okay at best. There is no variation and, like I said above, the character is completely absent and is usually uninteresting at best. Also I've heard quite a few songs that have a reasonably mellow backing and tune, then try to compliment it with rim clicks from the snare. The rim click samples are, frankly, bad. They sound like the clicking sound you make from your mouth, and have no ambience at all. Combined with the harsh mixing, and it creates a periodic skull piercer that removes me from the music, even if the song was otherwise quite good. <br/>
            <br/>As for how I would like to record drums, it's (on the surface), a fair bit simpler: stick a nice stereo microphone in front of it. Let the drummer play their dynamics how they think is best and let the character of the kit shine through. A stereo microphone specifically is best because it generally acts as two microphones a similar distance apart as your ears are. If you're wearing headphones, this makes it sound as if you are standing in front of the drumkit, and it's gorgeous. The main challenge is when you're mixing the song in the studio, since it needs to sound like everyone is in the same space and this could make it much harder. However, in my opinion, the improvement in sound quality is well worth it, even with a mediocre drummer and kit. A poorly recorded/mixed drumkit ruins a song, at least to me.

        <h3>Full (Musical) Group Recording</h3>
        <div>
            This one is very similar to the above point. In short, my favourite way to record a group is live, in concert. It usually sounds less manufactured and there's more detail. <br/>
            <br/>In long, live recordings create an atmosphere and feeling that is usually much nicer than studio recordings. It is usually easier to hear harmonies and has a more detailed soundstage, which makes it more interesting for me to listen to. There's all the effects of the space the musicians are performing; spaces which are often made to sound quite nice. Instead of feeling like people are singing into your ear, there is a distance created which makes it very interesting to listen to and feels more like somebody is a bit away and performing to you instead of the wall of sound that studio recordings can create. <br/>
            <br/>I think a good example of this contrast is with the High Kings, a contemporary Irish folk group. While I don't have many issues with their studio recordings, they can feel a bit bland. Their live recordings, however are very nice. Take "Star Of The County Down", for example. While there aren't any glaring issues with the  <button  class="inlineButton" onclick="window.open(href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1Q-UL3qcTo');"><i>Memory Lane</i> studio recording</button>, it is a bit hard to hear the harmonies and doesn't have a whole ton of energy. That's not to say it's a bad recording; it is quite good. However, their recording from <button  class="inlineButton" onclick="window.open(href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne3bqM2O1xs');"><i>Live in Ireland</i></button> is, in my opinion, much better. There's much more energy, which is partially from the faster tempo, but it's amplified by the presence of the audience. The live recording sounds much more like they are having fun, and the audience is clearly enjoying it. You can also hear the reverb of the space, which makes it feel more interesting to listen to. <br/>
            <br/>While I understand that studio recordings are more technically precise and are better in many ways, I love hearing the audience and the more authentic feeling of a live recording, which is quite hard to replicate in a studio. <br/>
            <br/>With the exception of live recordings, my general favourite way to have a group be recorded is actually the same as with just a drumkit: stick a nice stereo microphone in front of them. Yes, it will be less perfect, and you may need to adjust distances or have a voice mic to make sure everyone can be heard. However, it feels more genuine and, in my opinion, is much more impressive than the traditional way of manufacturing the sound to be exactly correct.
            <br/>Yes, I realize that this is basically just a live recording in the studio. I still prefer it.

        <h3>Love Songs</h3>
        <div>
            It's definitely important for me to mention that I have very little knowledge outside of Irish/Scottish folk music and nautical songs/sea shanties. This will mostly/entirely focus on those. <br/>
            <br/>Now this is one that is interesting. I quite like Irish love songs; they are able to inspire a lot of emotion and can be very impactful. However, most of these songs are not "oh wow this person is wonderful and that's all I'm going to talk about". They are most often songs of mourning. Take <button class='inlineButton' onclick="window.open(href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRy9eRbS-Dc');"><i>Red is the Rose</i></button>, for example. It is a song that tells of a beautiful girl whom the narrator pledged himself to, and it tells the story of how that came to be. Then comes the last verse; she is dead, this is a song remembering this character. The mournful tones are also present in how it uses the melody of the Scottish <i>Loch Lomond</i> (I don't know of a recording I love of this one just yet), where (despite being used in weddings) the chorus state that "me and my true love will never meet again", and it is generally a mournful song. The exact interpretation varies, but the most common is that the narrator is set to die, and is singing the song to his friend, who will live. The exact details are beyond the scope of this, but I would be glad to talk about it more some other time.<br/>
            <br/>There are many more examples of this, but the majority of the time Irish love songs are really not happy. I love listening to them. I have a hard time processing and expressing emotions, and listening to Irish love songs is one of the few ways I have found to really express and process them.<br/>
            <br/>The song I would generally say is my favourite is actually a love song. It was written by an American writer by the name of Michael Peter Smith, though I know it as it is recorded by Liam Clancy. It's called <button class='inlineButton' onclick="window.open(href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81afL-zz_Pc');"><i>The Dutchman</i></button>, and it tells the story of a man who's gone senile and his wife Margaret, who live in Amsterdam. It has a hint of sadness, as she watches what is happening to him. It's a song of unconditional love, as Margaret cares for him through the years. It's one that makes me genuinely feel quite happy and is rather relaxing.
