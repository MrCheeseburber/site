        <h1>Hello There</h1>
        <h2>This is a goofy little thing I decided to make, mostly for my own enjoyment</h2>
        <div></br>You're probably here because I gave you a little note that directed you here. Either that or you were looking through my code (which if that's the case: rude. i had a comment saying not to look too closely). But I'm going to assume that's not what happened, and that you're here because of <i>the note</i>.
        </br></br> As you now know... I like you, and am extremely awkward. I thought of this idea when I was going to bed one night and was really excited to make a new webpage (it's been a while since I last programed, this has been a fun project). As I hopefully remembered to detail in the note, everything here is purely your choice to participate or to not. If you don't participate at all, that is totally fine, I will not be offended in the slightest (again, I mostly made this for my own enjoyment).</br></br>
        On this page, I will include a few things that might be able to help you know a few basic things about me and vise versa. Everything is completely optional. I would advise avoiding putting sensitive information in any places where there is an option for text input, because I don't know how to secure it properly, so somebody else could potentially (but probably won't) get access to it.</br></br>
        That is probably all the information you might need to navigate this site, below I will link pages for the afformentioned purpose, with a small description of what they are.</div>
        <button onclick="window.location.href = './preferencesForm.html';">Here's a form!</button>
